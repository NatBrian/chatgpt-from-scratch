    "\n",

    "- Bigram sees only: \"the\"\n",
    "- Bigram guesses: \"end\" (because \"the end\" is common)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Simple Explanation: Volume Control**\n",
    "Imagine you are listening to a playlist. Some songs are very quiet, and some are extremely loud. If a song is too loud, it hurts your ears (in AI, this \"exploding\" signal breaks the model). If it's too quiet, you can't hear the details (the model stops learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "As data flows through the deep layers of a neural network, the numbers can get wildly big or vanishingly small. We need a way to keep them in a \"goldilocks\" zone -- just right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Solution is RMSNorm -- The Automatic Volume Knob\n",
    "\n",
    "**RMSNorm** is like an automatic volume stabilizer.\n",
    "1.  It listens to the current signal (the numbers coming out of a layer).\n",
    "2.  It calculates the average \"loudness\" (magnitude).\n",
    "3.  It divides the signal by that loudness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This forces all the numbers to stay within a standard range (like -1 to 1), making the AI stable and easy to train.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"RMS\"?**\n",
    "It stands for **Root Mean Square**. It's just a fancy way of calculating the \"average loudness\" of a group of numbers. Llama 3 uses this because it's simple and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Motivation: Scale Invariance**\n",
    "In deep networks, activations can grow uncontrollably (explode) or shrink to zero (vanish).\n",
    "RMSNorm normalizes the activations $x$ by their Root Mean Square:\n",
    "$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{x}{\\text{RMS}(x)} $$\n",
    "This ensures that the scale of the weights does not affect the scale of the gradients, stabilizing training."

    "1.  **Linear Warmup:**\n",

    "GPU memory is limited. We might only fit 4 samples at a time ($B_{micro}=4$). But Transformers need large batches (e.g., $B=128$) for stable gradients.\n",
    "**Solution:** We run the forward/backward pass $N$ times, accumulating gradients in the `.grad` attribute, and only call `optimizer.step()` once.\n",

    "The Base Model approximates the probability distribution of the internet $P_{pretrain}(x)$. This distribution is high-entropy and noisy. It includes code, stories, essays, and random chatter.\n",
    "When we ask a question, the model might just continue the text (e.g., by adding more questions) because that's what it saw in training data (like a forum page).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Explanation: The Etiquette Class**\n",
    "The Base Model is like a wild child who just blabbers whatever comes to mind.\n",
    "**SFT** is like sending it to etiquette school. We teach it:\n",
    "- \"When a User speaks, you listen.\"\n",
    "- \"When it's your turn, you answer helpfully.\"\n",
    "We use special tags (like `<|im_start|>`) to mark who is speaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Mechanism: Chat Templates (Special Tokens)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To help the model distinguish between \"User\" and \"Assistant\", we introduce **Special Control Tokens** that were not present in the pre-training data.\n",
    "Common formats (like ChatML) look like this:\n",
    "`<|im_start|>user\\nHello<|im_end|>\\n<|im_start|>assistant\\nHi there!<|im_end|>`\n",
    "\n",
    "These tokens act as \"triggers\" for the model to switch modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theoretical Motivation: Distribution Shift**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)** forces a **Distribution Shift**. We want to move from $P_{pretrain}$ to $P_{assistant}$, a lower-entropy subspace where the model always acts as a helpful agent.\n",
    "- The Base Model approximates the pre-training distribution $P_{pretrain}(x)$ (internet noise).\n",
    "SFT forces a **Distribution Shift** to $P_{assistant}(y|x)$.\n",
